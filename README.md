# HuffmanEncoder
Using Binary Heap, I created a Huffman encoder to encode string letters into binary code for optimized retrieval of character data.

Files titled Huffman are what I have coded for encoder, main is located on the HuffmanConverter.java. 

I have utilized Binary Heaps and nodes from other authors in order to implement for huffman encoding.
